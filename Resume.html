      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>With a BE in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, I joined Tata Consultancy Services as an Assistant System Engineer in September 2022. I have been working on various projects involving AWS, cloud computing, and machine learning, applying my skills and knowledge to solve real-world problems.</p>
      <p>I am passionate about learning new technologies and exploring new domains. During my studies, I was a student member of IEEE and developed an interest in solar photovoltaic systems and machine learning. I have obtained multiple certifications in these fields, which have enabled me to contribute to the development and optimization of solar PV systems and ML models. I value punctuality, time management, and adaptability in my work environment. I aspire to grow as a professional and a leader in the IT industry.</p>
